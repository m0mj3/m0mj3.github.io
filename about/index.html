                        Hey! I'm Momje, I'm from the United States
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm 15 and I live in on the East Coast, I love learning, video editing, reading and playing Video Games such as Minecraft and osu!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm constantly learning, and take every opportunity to learn and expand on things that I work on. 
                        I usually push the limits of what is asked of me, and that helps me learn and in turn adds more to the project I am working on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By utilizing said energy and hyperness, I can channel it into dedication to what I do. 
                        Projects I work on, even if I'm juggling many at once, equally get attention and my full effort as I pursue them. 
                        I push the limits of not only my own ability, but how I can make the experience for those whom are going to use what I make. 
                        This drive makes me not only better as a developer, but also as a person to work with and be around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks for reading my really quick about me :)
                    </p>
